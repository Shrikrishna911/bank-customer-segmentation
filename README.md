# Customer segmentation on data of Union Bank of Bolivia. 
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs.
We use K-Means Clustering which is an unsupervised learning algorithm to segment the bank data.
Data: We download Bank_data from data world website.
Environment and Tools used: Jupyter Notebook, R Studio, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
We perform Exploratory data analysis, feature selection and import and use the Kmeans model in both environments called Jupyter Notebook and R studio.
Elbow Method is used to find the optimum clusters.
Then using K value found out from elbow method , we represent the data in form of variuos clusters.
